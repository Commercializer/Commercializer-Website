        </p>

          the law and our list of Dos and Don’ts. You are responsible for anything that happens
          through your account unless you close it or report misuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          As between you and others, your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were
          purchased by another party for you to use (e.g. for a business development role bought by
          your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and
          get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your
          personal account.
        </p>

        <h4>2.3 Payment</h4>

          However, in the absence of negligence on our part, any failure by us to comply with this
          contract or our Privacy Policy (see clause 3) or breach by us of our duties under
          applicable laws we will not be legally responsible to you for any loss that you may suffer
          if a third party gains unauthorized access to any information that you give us.
        </p>

          If your payment is not received by us and you have already received the goods, you: must
          pay for such goods immediately; or must return them to us as soon as possible. If so, you
          must keep the goods in your possession, take reasonable care of them (including ensuring
          that you follow any instructions or manuals given with the goods) and not use them before
          you return them to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do not return any goods (such as where you have not paid for them) we may collect
          the goods from you at your expense. We will try to contact you to let you know if we
          intend to do this. Nothing in this clause affects your legal rights to cancel the contract
          during the ‘cooling off’ period under clauses 5 and 6.

        <p>
          The cancellation period will expire after 14 days from the day on which you acquire, or a
          third party other than the carrier and indicated by you acquires, physical possession of
          the goods. To exercise the right to cancel, you must inform us of your decision to cancel
          this contract by a clear statement (e.g. an email) using the contact details at the top of

        <p>

          concerning your exercise of the right to cancel before the cancellation period has
          expired.
